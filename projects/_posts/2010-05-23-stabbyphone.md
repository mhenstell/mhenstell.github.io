In 2010, [NYC Resistor](nycresistor.com) sent a small delegation to the first TechCrush Disrupt 24 hour hackathon in New York. 

<!--break-->

Our farcical idea was to bring a large and unwieldy pneumatic robot that we had sitting around (lovingly dubbed Mr. Stabby). With some help from the [Twilio](twilio.com) team, we turned our ordinary stabbing robot into a phone-controlled stabbing machine, complete with dramatic telephone prompts Ã¡la MoviePhone.

We ended up being one of the only groups working on hardware hacking, and despite our project not being remotely relevant to the theme of the conference, we won a runner-up trophy for our efforts. I even got to show off the robot to VCs and other conference attendees on the last day of the show.
