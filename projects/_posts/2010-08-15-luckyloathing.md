In 2010 [NYC Resistor](nycresistor.com) was approached by a video production company who was organizing a contest between several American hackerspaces. The idea was for each hackerspace to form a small team who would complete a challenge: They had to repurpose an item and it had to be based on a movie. 

<!--break-->

We chose to build a BarBot (the third in Resistor history) using an old Japanese slot machine we found on CraigsList. We based the re-branded machine based on the movie [Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120669/)

Check out the two short NYC Resistor episodes below:
