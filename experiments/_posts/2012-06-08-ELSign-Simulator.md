![EL Sign Simulator](/images/{{page.img}}/big/1.png)

I had an idea kicking around for a while for a large matrix screen made out of LED pixels. On top of pixels are clear plastic rods made out of [Endlighten](http://www.acrylite-shop.com/US/us/rod-636y4svddnd/acrylite-ff-endlighten-colorless-0n002-xl-b5jdxlddido~p.html) material. 

<!--break-->

This material is unique in that it's impregnated with microscopic metal particles that reflect and diffuse light, making the rods glow from light that enters either end.

I whipped up a quick Processing sketch to help me visualize such a sign in 3D. It's based on my previous work on the [Domestar](/domestar) project - the data for the pixels comes from the domeTransmitter Processing sketch, and the results are displayed on a matrix of glowing tubes, arranges in a wave pattern.
