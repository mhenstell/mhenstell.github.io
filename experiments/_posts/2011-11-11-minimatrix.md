The MiniMatrix was a quick little project I threw together based on a two-color LED matrix.

I liked the square look of the pixels, so I bought the display on a whim. I ended up making a cute little desktop display out of it. I modified the PeggyDraw Processing sketch to support colors, and drew out about 30 seconds worth of animations that loop constantly on the device.
