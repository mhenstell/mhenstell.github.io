This is a quick project I threw together for Burning Man 2011. I spent all week at CCC Camp sewing a grid of high-power white LEDs into a suit jacket. The jacket is controlled by a series of Texas Instruments TLC series PWM controllers on the high side, and series of mosfets on the low side of the matrix. I ended up running the suit all night on one 9V battery, because it was too blinding at full power, even in the expanse of the desert.
