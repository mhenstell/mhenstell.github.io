Inspired by [this project](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/135) posted on SparkFun, I hacked a Nike+ receiver to unlock my car door when I got near the car. It took a fair bit of tuning so that the car wouldn't unlock from half a block away, but it worked quite well. The hardest part was remembering to carry the transmitter with me.
