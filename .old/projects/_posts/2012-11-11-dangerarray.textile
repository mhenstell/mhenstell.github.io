The DangerArray (or Incandescent Lighting Array) was a quick project that I threw together for the "NYC Resistor Interactive Show.":http://www.flickr.com/photos/osr/sets/72157629813571332/with/7233737690/ It consists of seventy two 120 Volt halogen lamps, each individually controllable and dimmable by way of a large array of shift registers and mosfets, controlled from one USB-enabled microcontroller. The Array uses the same C++ and Processing software that we used on the "DomeStar.":/domestar

The DangerArray is still installed at NYC Resistor, although it is no longer powered-up, for good reason.
