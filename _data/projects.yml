- project: Death & Taxis (art car)
  role: Creator
  duration: 2015 &mdash; 2016
  # url: "#"
  description: Death & Taxis was a seven foot long, coffin-shaped art car painted to look like a New York City taxi. 
               I designed it in Solidworks, then cut and welded it together from scratch. It utilized a 14hp electrical motor and steer-by-wire controls, along with
               a 200 Ah battery bank with onboard generator for charging. The car was disassembled and flat-packed for shipping from Brooklyn to Nevada
               and was reassembled at Burning Man 2016.

- project: Domestar
  role: Co-Creator

  description: One of the early large-scale Arduino-based LED sculptures. Domestar was a 16-foot (now 30-foot) custom-fabricated PVC dome covered in 
               6,400 individually-addressable RGB LEDs, controlled and mapped via custom Processing software. I did electrical and firmware design
               and implementation, as well as structure fabrication and Processing/C++ work.
